# Arduino_INS
Arduino based INS navigation and self steer system for sailboats
The purpose of this project is to create a low power consumption navigation and self steering system for sailboats as generating electricity is not easy or gauranteed
I am using sample code from the 9 axes motion shield webpage: http://www.arduino.org/products/shields/arduino-9-axes-motion-shield
I am currently using an Arduino MEGA 2560 but intend to switch to either a DIYDuino or an Arduino MINI PRO
